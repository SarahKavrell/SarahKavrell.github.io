About Me
	</h1>

	<body>
<p>I'm an educator living in San Francisco. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I wanted to understand what my students were doing!</p>
<h2> 
	My Mission
	</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work doing web design on the side with independent artists because I like the intersection between logic and design.</p>
<h2> 
	My Experience
	</h2>
	<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

			<li>Program Producer, General Assembly, 2014-2015</li>
